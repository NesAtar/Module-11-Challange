Ive made a full web-scraping and data analysis project.  i've learned to identify HTML elements on a page, 
identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing
with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.  Ive also learned to scrape various types of information.  
These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
